# Max for Live Custom UI Element Painter Files

Currently, this repository only includes a simple painter file for changing the appearance of a `live.slider` object.

As I continue working with Max for Live, I plan to include the other painter files that I create.

An example of this painter file in action can be found here: [Channel Aftertouch](https://maxforlive.com/library/device/9430/channel-aftertouch)
